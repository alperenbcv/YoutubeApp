## 1-DTO-Entity-Model Objects
DTO is a simple object used to transfer data between layers. In this application, it is used to get data from the user and display data to the user. For example, when displaying user information, we need to avoid showing sensitive data such as passwords.

Entity is a class that represents a table in the database. It contains fields and behaviors and is more detailed than a DTO.

Model is a class that defines the business logic and rules of an application. It represents the state and behavior of the app. It includes methods to manipulate data, which is retrieved from entities and DTOs. For example, while the Video entity has a userId field, the Video model contains a User object.

## 2-Controller-Service-Repository Layers
Controller Layer: The controller layer serves as a bridge between the user interface and the business logic. It receives data from the user and sends it to the service layer for further processing.

Repository Layer: The repository layer is responsible for interacting with the database. It contains methods for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database entities.

### Service Layer
The service layer contains the core business logic of the application. It acts as an intermediary between the controller and the repository. For example, in this application, the service layer is used to validate user input during registration. If a user is already registered with the same username or email, the service prevents the database from saving duplicate credentials.

UserService.checkEmail(String email) -> First, a ConnectionProvider object is created to handle the database connection. The executeQuery method is called with a SQL query to check if an email exists in the tbluser table. The query result is wrapped in an Optional<ResultSet>. If the ResultSet is present, the method checks if there is a matching email by calling rs.next(). If a matching email is found, the method returns true. If no result is found or an exception occurs, it returns false.

UserService.checkUsername(String username) -> First, a ConnectionProvider object is created to handle the database connection. The executeQuery method is called with a SQL query to check if a username exists in the tbluser table. The result of the query is wrapped in an Optional<ResultSet>. If the ResultSet is present, the method checks if there is a matching username by calling rs.next(). If a matching username is found, the method returns true. If no result is found or an exception occurs, it returns false.

UserService.save() -> the user's email is checked first. If the email is unique (i.e., checkEmail() returns false), the checkUsername() method is called to validate the uniqueness of the username. If both the email and username are unique, the user is saved in the repository. If either the email or username already exists, the method returns an empty Optional without saving the user.

UserService.update() -> The method first checks if the user with the given ID exists by calling another method which is findById(). If the user is present it proceeds with the update. If not the method returns an empty Optional.

UserService.delete() -> The method first checks if the user with the given ID exists by calling another method which is findById(). If the user is present it proceeds with the delete and returns true. If not the method returns false.

UserService.findAll() -> The method doesnt have any logic, it just returns userRepository.findAll() method.

UserService.findAllAsDTO() -> First findAll method is called which returns as List. And then another List which holds UserDTO objects is created. Every user data in the first list used for manipulate to create UserDTO object. Finally, each UserDTO is added to the UserDTO list, and the method returns this list of UserDTO objects.

UserService.findByUsernameAsDTO(String username) -> First, the findByUsername method from the userRepository is called, which returns an Optional<User>. If a user with the given username is found, a UserDTO object is created using the data from the retrieved User object. The UserDTO is then wrapped in an Optional and returned. If no user is found, the method returns an empty Optional.

## 3-Utility Package

### A-Connection Provider
Connection, PreparedStatement and ResultSet objects are declared as fields in this class. 

openConnection() -> DriverManager.getConnection() method is called and the URL given as parameter to the method. The parameter URL formed from HOSTNAME, PORT, DB NAME, USERNAME, PASSWORD fields. Which declared as constants in Constant.class. If Connection object is successfully created the method returns true.

closeConnection() -> This method first checks if the Connection object is already closed by using the isClosed() method. If the connection is not closed, the close() method is called to close the connection, and the method returns true.

executeUpdate(String sql) -> The method first call openConnection() method and if its returns true, which means Connection object is created successfully, first it calls prepareStatement(sql), which creates a PreparedStatement object for sending parameterized SQL statements to the database. Then executeUpdate() called which executes the SQL statement in this PreparedStatement object. This method is typically used for SQL statements like INSERT INTO, UPDATE, ALTER, etc. After executing the statement, the method attempts to close the connection by calling closeConnection().

executeQuery(String sql) -> This method first calls the openConnection() method. If it returns true, meaning the connection was successfully established, the prepareStatement(sql) method is called to create a PreparedStatement object for executing the query. The executeQuery() method is then called to execute the SQL query, which returns a ResultSet. The ResultSet is wrapped in an Optional and returned. This method typically used for SQL statements like SELECT etc.

### B-ICRUD
ICRUD<T> This is a generic interface that defines common CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for any type T.

save(T t) -> Takes an object of type T and returns an Optional<T>. This method is used to save the object to the database and returns the saved object wrapped in an Optional if the save operation is successful.

update(T t) -> Takes an object of type T and returns an Optional<T>. This method updates the object in the database and returns the updated object wrapped in an Optional if the update is successful.

delete(Long id) -> Takes an ID of type Long and returns a boolean. This method deletes the object associated with the given ID from the database. It returns true if the deletion is successful, otherwise false.

findAll() -> Returns a List<T> containing all objects of type T from the database.

findById(Long id) -> Takes an ID of type Long and returns an Optional<T>. This method finds and returns the object associated with the given ID, wrapped in an Optional.


### C-SQLQueryBuilder

I- generateInsert(Object entity, String tablename) -> This method generates an SQL INSERT statement for the given entity and table. The class of the entity is retrieved using entity.getClass(), and the fields are extracted using getDeclaredFields(). Two StringBuilder objects (columns and values) are used to hold the columns and corresponding values for the SQL statement. Finally, the method returns a fully formed INSERT INTO SQL statement, combining the table name, columns, and values.

II- generateUpdate(Object entity, String tablename) -> This method generates an SQL UPDATE statement for the given entity and table. Similar to the generateInsert() method, the entityâ€™s class and fields are retrieved. The method loops through the fields, and when it finds a field named id, it retrieves its value to use in the WHERE clause. Finally, the method returns a fully formed UPDATE SQL statement, including the SET clause and WHERE clause with the id.
